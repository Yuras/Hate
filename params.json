{"name":"Hate","tagline":"A small 2D game framework in Haskell, for Haskell","body":"HÃ¤te\r\n======\r\n\r\n[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/bananu7/Hate.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/bananu7/Hate)\r\n\r\nHate is a small framework for graphical haskell games and applications. It's heavily inspired by [Love](http://love2d.org/) and aims at similar ease of use, but within the power of Haskell's type and concurrency safety.\r\n\r\nHate features a pure 2D rendering API, backed by raw, low-level OpenGL, and a simple way to gather input from the user (via [GLFW-b](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/GLFW-b)).\r\n\r\nThe `samples` folder features a few examples on how to get started, but you have to consider the API to be extremely unstable and it's subject to change at any time.\r\n\r\nFeel free to submit feature requests, opinions etc. through the GitHub issues system.\r\n\r\n###Installation\r\n\r\nHate is developed and tested using GHC. If you're a beginner, the easiest way to get it is [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/). You probably also want Git.\r\n\r\nTo verify the installation, do this:\r\n\r\n    $ ghc --version\r\n    The Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compilation System, version 7.8.3\r\n\r\n    $ cabal --version\r\n    cabal-install version 1.18.0.5\r\n    using version 1.18.1.3 of the Cabal library\r\n    \r\nIf it looks similar (the numbers are bigger), then it's probably OK. To proceed, run those commands:\r\n\r\n    git clone https://github.com/bananu7/Hate.git\r\n    cd Hate\r\n    cabal sandbox init\r\n    cabal install --dependencies-only\r\n    cabal run sample_shapes\r\n    \r\nTo use sandboxing functionality, you need a fairly recent Cabal, but it's highly recommended, as it helps to avoid a lot of problems. You can then install Hate into that sandbox by typing `cabal install`.\r\n\r\nThe samples available at the time of writing are:\r\n\r\n * `sample_shapes`\r\n * `sample_scheduler`\r\n * `sample_sprite`\r\n * `sample_spritesheet`\r\n * `sample_asteroids`\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
