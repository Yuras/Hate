glisha
======

Glisha is a small framework for graphical haskell games and applications. It's heavily inspired by [Love2D](http://love2d.org/) and aims at similar ease of use, but within the power of Haskell's type and concurrency safety.

Glisha features two sets of APIs, 2D and 3D, both backed by raw, low-level OpenGL, and a simple way to gather input from the user (via [GLFW-b](http://hackage.haskell.org/package/GLFW-b)).

The `samples` folder features a few examples on how to get started, but you have to consider the API to be extremely unstable and it's subject to change at any time. That's why it all resides on `develop` branch.

Feel free to submit feature requests, opinions etc. through the GitHub issues system.
